# âš½ Football Manager Simulator (Python)

A Python based Football Manager simulation that models football teams, players, and matches with probabilistic outcomes. This is a personal side project aimed at exploring OOP design, simulations, and will later include a GUI interface and deployment.

## ðŸš€ Features (+ to be added)

- Teams with real individual players, positions, and dynamic skill ratings
- Simulate matches between two teams using probabilistic outcomes based on team strength
- Includes randomness to ensure realistic results (better teams donâ€™t always win)
- Track player performance (e.g. goals scored, assists â€” WIP)
- Planned GUI interface (coming soon)
- Future deployment
- + Many more features to be planned

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- Each player has attributes: name, position, rating, and goals (will add more as i work on this)
- A team consists of a full squad of players (18) and an overall rating (calculated from player ratings)
- Match simulation uses a weighted random probability model:
  - Takes into account average team rating
  - Adds a draw chance
  - Simulates outcomes: win, lose, or draw
- Transfers and Budegt will be added to the game aswell
- Planning of adding a Champions League & Europa League to the game
- Possibility of individual awards to be added i.e Balon D'or, Player of the season etc...
 
## ðŸ›  Technologies (so far)

- Python 3.x
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)


## ðŸŽ¯ Future Plans

- [ ] Match score tracking
- [ ] League & season simulation
- [ ] Player form, fatigue, and stats
- [ ] GUI
- [ ] Cup fixtures
- [ ] Transfers and Club budget
